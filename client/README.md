# Client Side JS

All JS in this folder is meant to run in the browser.

As always...as always, kindly do, `npm i` to get the necessary modules installed from the list of `devDependencies` and `depnedencies` in 'package.json'

---

'index.html', 'styles.css' and 'scripts.js' for `// TODO`s

**Work on a separate `branch`.** - `git checkout -b dev`. Don't use `master`. It will be easier to update this in class together then and not get too many things mixed up.
